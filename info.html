        <h1>Understanding Income Tax Regimes (2024-25)</h1>
        <p>India offers two tax regimes: the <strong>Old Tax Regime</strong> and the <strong>New Tax Regime</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="regime">
            <h2>Old Tax Regime</h2>
            <p>The Old Tax Regime allows taxpayers to claim deductions and exemptions to reduce their taxable income.</p>

            <h3>‚úÖ Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tax-saving benefits:</strong> You can claim deductions under:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 80C (Investments in PPF, EPF, LIC, ELSS, etc. up to ‚Çπ1.5 lakh)</li>
                        <li>Section 80D (Health insurance premiums)</li>
                        <li>House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA)</li>
                        <li>Interest on home loans (Section 24(b)) up to ‚Çπ2 lakh per year</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Encourages savings and investments:</strong> The deductions incentivize taxpayers to invest in schemes like PPF, NPS, and life insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Suitable for salaried individuals:</strong> People with fixed salaries can plan their tax savings by utilizing deductions and exemptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduces taxable income significantly:</strong> If you claim maximum deductions, your tax liability can be much lower compared to the New Tax Regime.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>‚ùå Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex and time-consuming:</strong> Requires proper tax planning, investment proof, and paperwork to claim deductions.</li>
                <li><strong>Not beneficial for low-investment individuals:</strong> If you don‚Äôt make tax-saving investments, you might pay more tax compared to the New Tax Regime.</li>
                <li><strong>Limits liquidity:</strong> Since you need to invest in tax-saving schemes, your funds get locked in for a long time (e.g., PPF has a 15-year lock-in).</li>
                <li><strong>Higher tax rates:</strong> The tax rates in this regime are higher than those in the New Tax Regime.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="regime">
            <h2>New Tax Regime</h2>
            <p>The New Tax Regime offers lower tax rates but removes most deductions and exemptions.</p>

            <h3>‚úÖ Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower tax rates:</strong> The tax rates are reduced compared to the Old Regime, making it attractive for those without deductions.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplified tax filing:</strong> No need to maintain investment proofs or claim deductions, making the process easier.</li>
                <li><strong>More take-home salary:</strong> Since there‚Äôs no need to invest in tax-saving instruments, you have more money in hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Better for those with no investments:</strong> If you don‚Äôt claim deductions, the New Regime might result in lower tax payments.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax-free income up to ‚Çπ7 lakh:</strong> Under Section 87A, if your income is up to ‚Çπ7 lakh, you don‚Äôt need to pay any tax.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>‚ùå Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No major deductions or exemptions:</strong> You cannot claim benefits under Section 80C, 80D, HRA, LTA, home loan interest, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Not beneficial for high earners:</strong> If you have a high income and can claim many deductions, you may end up paying more tax in this regime.</li>
                <li><strong>No incentives for savings and investments:</strong> Unlike the Old Regime, this does not encourage tax-saving investments like PPF, NPS, and life insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Less suitable for salaried individuals with exemptions:</strong> If you receive HRA, LTA, and other allowances, you lose those benefits.</li>
            </ul>
